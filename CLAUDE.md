# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A single-file personal dividend-portfolio tracker (`portfolio.html`) for two people (재남 / 은경) holding mostly monthly-distribution Korean ETFs across several brokerage accounts. It tracks holdings, valuations, and monthly dividend income, and visualizes progress toward a goal (₩10,000,000/month in distributions by 2029-02-28).

There is **no build system, package manager, test suite, or lint config**. The entire app — HTML, CSS (`<style>`), and JS (`<script>`) — lives in `portfolio.html` (~3900 lines). Open the file in a browser to run it; there is nothing to compile.

## Working in this repo

- **Editing**: The file is large with inline styles and one big script block. Use Grep to locate a function/section by line before editing rather than reading the whole file. Function definitions are plain `function name()` / `async function name()` at column 0, so `^(async )?function <name>` finds them fast.
- **Preview**: Just open `portfolio.html` in a browser (the launch preview panel also renders it). No dev server.
- **Commit/push**: History is a linear series of single-file "Update portfolio.html" commits on `main`, pushed to `origin` (GitHub `jaenamking1-collab/jjk`). Git identity is set locally as `jaenamking1-collab <jaenamking1@gmail.com>` (not global — new clones must set it). Only commit/push when asked.

## Architecture

**Frontend (this repo)** ⇄ **Google Apps Script backend** (a Google Sheets–backed web app).

- The backend URL is the `API` constant at the top of the `<script>` (`https://script.google.com/macros/s/.../exec`). All persistence lives in Google Sheets behind it — this repo has no database.
- Two client helpers wrap every call:
  - `api(params)` — GET via `API + '?' + URLSearchParams`, returns JSON. Used for all reads.
  - `apiPost(data)` — POST with JSON body. Used for all writes.
- `state` (global object) holds the in-memory cache: `accounts`, `holdings`, `dividends`, `exchangeRate`, `currentYear`, `stockList`. Most tabs re-fetch from the API on activation rather than trusting the cache.

### Backend action contract

Reads (`api`): `getExchangeRate`, `getAccounts`, `getHoldings`, `getDividends`, `getSheetData`, `getDivSheetData`, `getDistribution`, `getPortfolioLog`, `getPriceLog`, `getStockPrice`, `getEtfScreener`, `getEtfNotices`, `getStockList`, `getAlerts`, `markAlertRead`.

Writes (`apiPost`): `addAccount` / `updateAccount` / `deleteAccount`, `addHolding` / `updateHolding` / `deleteHolding`, `saveDividend`.

`getSheetData` / `getDivSheetData` return the raw Google Sheet contents used by the **sync** features to diff against app data before applying changes.

### Tabs (`showTab(name)` toggles `.page` elements)

1. **포트폴리오** (`tab-accounts`) — account list, per-person and combined summaries (invested / valuation / P&L / dividends / yield), category-weight tables.
2. **종목관리** (`tab-holdings`) — holdings by account or aggregated by ticker; add/edit/delete; "스프레드시트 동기화" diffs the sheet and lets you apply changes.
3. **분배금** (`tab-dividends`) — editable year×account grid of monthly dividend amounts (`.div-grid` / `.div-cell`); USD rows entered in dollars, everything totaled in KRW via `state.exchangeRate`.
4. **대시보드** (`tab-dashboard`) — goal progress bar + D-Day, stat cards, monthly-dividend chart, per-account cumulative return chart (day/month/year), top/bottom 5 by return.
5. **월배당 스크리너** (`tab-screener`) — searchable/filterable monthly-dividend ETF list from `getEtfScreener`.
6. **분배금공지** (`tab-distributions`) — issuer notices + distribution-schedule calendar + the 🔔 alerts panel.
7. **엑셀** (`tab-excel`) — import/export holdings and dividends via SheetJS.

### Conventions to preserve

- **Currency display**: KRW amounts are shown as plain numbers (no ₩ symbol); USD amounts keep a `$` prefix. The `USD ? '$' : ''` ternary and bare `toLocaleString()` are intentional — do not reintroduce a ₩ prefix on displayed values. The `₩` still inside the two `replace(/[₩$,↑↓▲▼+\s]/g,'')` regexes is functional (strips symbols before parsing a price) and must stay.
- **Font sizing**: dividend-grid cells use `font-size:1em` so the "글자" range slider (`applyDivFont`) can scale the whole grid uniformly. Avoid hardcoding px font sizes inside the grid.
- **CDN dependencies**: SheetJS (`xlsx.full.min.js`) and Pretendard font, both loaded from CDN in `<head>`.

## Files

- `portfolio.html` — the entire application.
- `README.md` — one line (`# jjk`); no other docs.
